# Code Challenge: Class 03

## Feature Task(s)

Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array. The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

## Stretch Goal

What would you need to change if the array contained objects (sorted on a given property), and you were searching for certain property value? Write out the pseudocode.
