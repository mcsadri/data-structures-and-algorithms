    A class representing a linked list data structure.

      * __init__(head=None): upon instantiation, an empty Linked List is created
      * insert(value): adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance
      * includes(value): indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list
      * __str__(): returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
